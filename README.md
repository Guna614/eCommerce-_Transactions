E-commerce Transactions Dataset - Data Science Assignment 🚀

This repository tackles a data science assignment centered around an e-commerce transactions dataset. 📁  Get ready to explore customer behavior, product trends, and gain valuable business insights!  💡

Data Provided:

Customers.csv: Customer details (ID, Name, Region, Signup Date)

Products.csv: Product information (ID, Name, Category, Price)

Transactions.csv: Transaction history (ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Transaction Date, Quantity, Total Value, Price)

Tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights (EDA.ipynb & Insights.pdf):

Deep dive into the data to uncover customer trends, product performance, and sales patterns. 📊
Extract at least 5 actionable business insights to guide future strategies. 🎯 (e.g., Top-selling categories, Customer acquisition trends)

2. Lookalike Model (LookalikeModel.ipynb & Lookalike.csv):

Build a model to identify customers similar to a given user based on profile and purchase history. 👥
Recommend the top 3 lookalike customers with similarity scores for the first 20 customers (C0001 - C0020). 🥇🥈🥉

3. Customer Segmentation/Clustering (Clustering.ipynb & Clustering_Report.pdf):

Group customers into distinct segments using K-Means clustering. 🏆 (Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and suitability for DB Index evaluation)
Leverage both customer and transaction data to create meaningful segments. 👥💰
Calculate the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) to assess cluster quality. 🧮
Visualize the clusters using informative plots for clear understanding. 📈

Why K-Means Clustering?

K-Means is a perfect fit for this task due to its:


Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand, making it ideal for customer segmentation.
Interpretability: Well-defined clusters with centroids that reveal valuable insights about each segment's characteristics.
DB Index Optimization: K-Means excels at minimizing within-cluster variance, which is crucial for a good DB Index.

This repository provides the Jupyter Notebooks (EDA.ipynb, LookalikeModel.ipynb, Clustering.ipynb) and reports (Insights.pdf, Clustering_Report.pdf) to guide you through the analysis and model building process. Feel free to explore, experiment, and uncover the hidden gems within the data!  💎
